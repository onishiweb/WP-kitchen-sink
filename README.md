# Base Wordpress Theme

This is a template theme for Wordpress development at One Ltd. The theme should contain all base code to work from for any generic website.

## Available functions

*	oneltd_get_subnav - A simple subnav function to get all children of the top level page relative to the current page (all levels) - or alternatively can be passed a WP Menu name
*	oneltd_get_breadcrumbs - Simple breadcrumb generator, displays pages in a list.
*	oneltd_content_nav - Page/post navigation for use on paginated pages or on single post pages
*	oneltd_comment - Custom function to generate comments
*	oneltd_posted_on - Prints HTML with meta information for the current post-date/time and author
*	oneltd_categorized_blog - 


## To Do: 

*	Some default styling to the pages - i.e. if content were to be dropped in, it would at least make the content look structured into pages etc
*	Double check the oneltd_comment function and make sure it's displaying a relatively simple view of comments - at the moment it probably displays too much stuff!
